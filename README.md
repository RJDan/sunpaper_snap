## Sunpaper

Sunpaper is a small utility to change wallpaper based around your local sunrise and sunset times. 

It works with several modified [dynamic themes](#wallpaper-previews) to change your wallpaper 8 times throughout the day depending on the position of the sun at your location and time of year.

## Why Sunpaper?

Sunpaper was developed to replicate the behavior of Apple Dynamic Desktop wallpapers. The Big Sur minimal wallpapers are beautiful and I wanted to use them on my linux machines. There are many other timed wallpaper utilities out there, but they all seemed to be using static timetables for the wallpaper changes. I wanted something that could be directly tied to the sunrise/sunset times locally and adapt to changes over the year without any fiddling on my part.
